The original mockup uses left-justified text and no hyphenation. Here it seems this was changed. 

The RoHS picture is misnamed, it should be called product picture or something similar

change history could be defined as an environment in the class as it is now it's very complex
Consider that there can be multiple entries in the change history, add a second version (anything you want) in the example to show your intent

the other tables always have the same format so they 

why are you using !ht everywhere? 

I understand using vspace within paracol, but in other places it shouldn't be necessary to use it so much

Tables need to have always the same font size so I don't know why the exmaple shows how to modify that
If resizing tables changes font size, then it should just not be allowed. 

The default table should have the header always with the highlight and always be centered, can this be integrated in an environment?

Our people should not use clearpage so I would remove it from the example

The less micromanaging we allow outside the class, the better. 

I need the template and example in a .zip so that I can test the flexibility of the template

Boxes and parallel content: people should not use these outside of the front page, and the front page should always have the same format. Can we just abstract all this away? 
Example: the front page environment just allows you to add using tags: 
- text
- highlights
specify a max length for these
- product picture
- product diagram
specify a size for these
- related products, this can be left as is (but consider the comment above about increasing the table abstraction by using environments)
the title should be the same variable as the product name used in the header on the following pages, here it being different is a mistake that will be fixed later
